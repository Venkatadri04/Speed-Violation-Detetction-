# 🚗 Speed Violation Detection System

A real-time vehicle speed monitoring system designed to detect and report overspeeding vehicles within private campuses such as tech parks, institutions, and residential areas. The system uses YOLOv8 for object detection, ByteTrack for tracking, and OpenCV for visualization and speed estimation.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time vehicle detection and tracking
- Speed estimation using virtual reference lines
- Alerts generated for vehicles exceeding a speed threshold (e.g., 30 km/h)
- Remote alert transmission to security systems via socket communication
- Visual display with bounding boxes and speed annotations

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Object Detection:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- **Tracking:** ByteTrack  
- **Visualization:** OpenCV  
- **Communication:** Python Socket Programming
